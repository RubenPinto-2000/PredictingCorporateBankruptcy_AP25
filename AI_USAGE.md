# AI Tools Usage Documentation

This document details the use of AI tools in the development of this project.

## AI Assistant Used

AI used: GEMINI (3.0)

## Main Uses of AI Tools

### 1. Code Development and Refactoring

- **Code Generation**: It proposed an initial structure with `=== STEP 1 ===` that I then used consistently to have a clear visualization in the display panel. It was, for example, the one who gave me this structure for this document.
- **Bug Fixes**: Identification and correction of syntax errors, logic errors, and import issues. It explained how I could implement my ideas when my attempts were not working.
- **Plot helps**: It strongly helped me with plots. It made the first cases as examples, and helped me obtain more qualitative visuals.
- **Download helps**: It helped me implement the direct download of the data, and the specific SSL handling.

### 2. Documentation

- **README.md**: Setup instructions to explain what I was doing, which allowed me to compare what I was doing with what was interpreted. This allowed me to modify it accordingly.
- **Code Comments**: Verified that my comments were correct, complete, and relevant.
- **Docstrings**: Verified that the docstring is correct.
- **Library**: Explanation of available libraries for certain roles and their functionality.
- **Concept**: Explanation of concepts, which allowed me to make my choices afterwards.

### 3. Data Science Guidance

- **Methodology Recommendations**: Suggestions on how I could handle my class imbalance.
- **Model Selection**: Help with the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors as I could not exploit it in that state, and explanation of the parameters of the model signatures. I then verified with the literature if relevant.
- **Statistical Tests**: Suggestions on which statistical tests to use, proposed paired t-test and McNemar's test for model comparison. Suggested the most relevant ones to use.

### 4. Code Optimization

- **Removing Redundancy**: Identification and removal of unused imports, variables, and functions to simplify the code, especially between modules.
- **Code Simplification**: Proposition to simplify complex logic while maintaining functionality correctly.
- **Best Practices**: Adherence to Python coding standards and project structure conventions.
- **Code Tested**: I used it constantly to verify that the code worked.
- **Verification code**: Verified if parts were not off-topic or unused.

### 5. Translation and Localization

- **French to English Translation**: Translation of all code comments, docstrings, and documentation from French to English.
- **Terminology Consistency**: Ensuring consistent use of technical terms throughout the codebase.

## Acknowledgment

So this project was developed with the assistance of AI tools; however, all design decisions, methodology choices, and final implementations are my responsibility.
